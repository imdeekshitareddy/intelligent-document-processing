# Intelligent Document Processing System 📄🤖

## Overview

This project is an **AI-powered Intelligent Document Processing system** that automatically extracts important information from PDF documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The system allows users to upload a document and automatically identifies:

* 👤 Names
* 📅 Dates
* 💰 Money Amounts
* 🏢 Organizations

The extracted information is displayed in a structured format.

## Features 🚀

* Upload PDF documents
* Automatic text extraction
* Named Entity Recognition (NLP)
* Structured JSON output
* Simple web interface
* Fast and lightweight system

## How It Works ⚙️

1. User uploads a PDF document
2. The system extracts text from the PDF
3. NLP model analyzes the text
4. Important entities are extracted
5. Results are displayed on the webpage
